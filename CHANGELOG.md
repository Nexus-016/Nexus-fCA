## [3.0.0] - 2025-09-11 - Advanced Core Release

### Overview
Version 3.0.0 represents a pivotal milestone in the evolution of the Nexus-fCA platform, transitioning from the iterative stabilization efforts of the 2.1.x series to a unified, production-ready foundation. This release is the culmination of extensive engineering, rigorous validation, and a commitment to delivering enterprise-grade reliability. The legacy diagnostics harness has been formally retired, replaced by a standardized internal instrumentation framework that streamlines monitoring, troubleshooting, and ongoing maintenance. These enhancements collectively reinforce the platform’s robustness, scalability, and operational transparency.

### Added
- **Delivery Receipt Health Metrics:** Introduced a comprehensive suite of metrics for delivery receipts, encompassing attempt counts, success rates, failure rates, timeout tracking, and adaptive disablement flags. These metrics provide granular visibility into delivery performance and facilitate proactive issue resolution.
- **Advanced Timeout Suppression Logic:** Implemented sophisticated suppression mechanisms for repeated delivery timeouts. This ensures consistent reply performance, mitigates the risk of systemic degradation, and enhances overall service reliability.
- **Internal Instrumentation Standardization:** All diagnostic and monitoring capabilities have been consolidated under a unified instrumentation framework, simplifying maintenance and enabling more effective root cause analysis.

### Changed
- **Documentation and Package Description:** The package description and README have undergone a comprehensive revision to align with professional standards and accurately reflect the platform’s positioning, capabilities, and intended use cases.
- **Semantic Versioning:** The major version increment to 3.0.0 signifies the platform’s maturity, stability, and readiness for mission-critical deployments. Importantly, there are no breaking changes to public APIs compared to the 2.1.x series, ensuring continuity for existing integrations.

### Notes
- **Upgrade Path:** Transitioning from 2.1.x to 3.0.0 is seamless. All documented interfaces remain unchanged, and the upgrade process requires no code modifications for existing consumers. The major version bump reflects strategic lifecycle consolidation and a renewed focus on long-term maintainability, rather than disruptive changes.
- **Lifecycle Consolidation:** This release unifies prior stabilization efforts, setting a new baseline for future enhancements and support. Users can expect ongoing improvements in reliability, observability, and operational efficiency.
